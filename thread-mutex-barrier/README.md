In this C file I implemented a barrier from ground up with the help of mutex.
Important sections:
barrier_t -> barrier data structure
barrier_init -> barrier initialization function
barrier_wait -> barrier wait function
barrier_destroy -> barrier destroy function

You can follow the comments on the file for further information.
